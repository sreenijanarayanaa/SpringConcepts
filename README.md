**=> IOC(Inversion of control)**
It is a concept/design principle where the framework takes the control of flow of execution.
The control of object creation and lifecycle is managed by the framework or the container rather than by the developer.
It is responsible for creating, configuring and managing the lifecycle of objects called beans.

**=> DI(Dependency Injection)**
Dependency inJection is a design pattern and a part of IOC, DI is the way we implement IOC.
It allows objects to be injected with their dependencies rather than us creating those dependencies.
